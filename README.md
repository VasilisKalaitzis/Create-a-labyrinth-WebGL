# Create-a-labyrinth-WebGL
This was my first 3D game using PHP, Javascript and WebGL technologies, created when I was 21 years old and attending university. This was my biggest project and kept me busy for several weeks.

The concept is simple. A room where the user has the ability to add blocks of stone, wood and other materials in order to create a labyrinth and hide pieces of cheese inside where the other users will be called to find. The user has the role of the creator, in which case he creates the labyrinth, or the player, in which case he enters the labyrinth of another player in order to complete his mission. These options  

Though you will notice that the code doesn't follow any coding standard (it wasn't created with reusability in mind, bad responsiveness and the structure could be a lot better) I am still very proud of my creation as it reflects my inexperienced self, my ever-burning passion and ambition as well as my creative thinking which are all parts of my first steps.

The reason behind this was to add practical material to the classes of the university regarding webGL and demonstrate what an individual can create with the use of a simple notepad and some code. For this project no blender was used, no copy-paste from other sources regarding the physics and the interactions and no tools other than JQuery library.

I hope you like it, because I still do!
